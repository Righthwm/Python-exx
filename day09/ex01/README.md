Elements of a relational database:tables,rows,columns, primary keys and foreign keys. In a relational database, a table is the same as a record, which is the fundamental data component. It is comprised of a set of fields that are the same in every table or record, such as the name, address and product of the customer. Relational database tables look much like an Excel spreadsheet when diagrammed for visual reference. The rows in each database table represent sequential values where the value in row 1A, for example, relates to the values in all the other fields in row 1. Columns in a relational database table are control features; each column represents a field of data that occurs consistently in each record or table throughout the database. Primary keys are identification tags for each row of data. The primary key is different for every record in the relational database. Foreign keys allow data searches and manipulation between the primary database table and other related databases.
