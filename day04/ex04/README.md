Static Routing is also known as non-adaptive routing which doesnâ€™t change routing table unless the network administrator changes or modify them manually. Static routing does not use complex routing algorithms and It provides high or more security than dynamic routing.
Dynamic routing is also known as adaptive routing which change routing table according to the change in topology. Dynamic routing uses complex routing algorithms and it does not provide high security like static routing. When the network change(topology) occurs, it sends the message to router to ensure that changes then the routes are recalculated for sending updated routing information.
Static Routing: routes are user defined, does not use complex routing algorithms, provides high or more security, is manual,  is implemented in small networks, additional resources are not required, failure of link disrupts the rerouting.
Dynamic Routing: routes are updated according to topology, uses complex routing algorithms, provides less security, is automated, is implemented in large networks, additional resources are required, failure of link does not interrupt the rerouting.
