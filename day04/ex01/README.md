Buckets are the basic containers that hold your data. Everything that you store in Cloud Storage must be contained in a bucket. You can use buckets to organize your data and control access to your data, but unlike directories and folders, you cannot nest buckets. While there is no limit to the number of buckets you can have in a project or location, there are limits to the rate you can create or delete buckets. The filesystem on your computer stores data in files and organizes files using directories. Cloud Storage stores data in objects and collects objects inside buckets. Buckets have a lot in common with directories, but there’s one major difference: Buckets can’t be nested. That is, you can’t organize buckets into a hierarchy in the way that you can organize directories.
