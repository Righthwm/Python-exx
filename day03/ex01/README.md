Compute Engine in GCP is the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) component of Google Cloud Platform. It secures and customizable computes service that lets you create and run virtual machines on Googleâ€™s infrastructure. Google Compute Engine enables users to launch virtual machines (VMs) on demand. VMs can be launched from the standard images or custom images created by users. GCE users must authenticate based on OAuth 2.0 before launching the VMs. Google Compute Engine can be accessed via the Developer Console, RESTful API or command-line interface (CLI).
