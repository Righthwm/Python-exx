External and internal IP addresses both serve the same purpose, the difference is scope. An external or public IP address is used across the entire Internet to locate computer systems and devices. A local or internal IP address is used inside a private network to locate the computers and devices connected to it. Internal IP address is for the local network only, it exists so that your router can tell the difference between the computer, the cell phone, a printer, or other devices are while they are connected to it, while your external IP address is the IP address of the router, this is what websites see when we are browsing the web.
