List comprehension in Python is an easy and compact syntax for creating a list from a string or another list. It is a very concise way to create a new list by performing an operation on each item in the existing list. List comprehension is considerably faster than processing a list using the for loop. The List Comprehension Syntax is [expression for element in iterable if condition]. This contains three parts: an expression, one or more for loop, and optionally, one or more if conditions. The list comprehension must be in the square brackets []. The result of the first expression will be stored in the new list. The for loop is used to iterate over the iterable object that optionally includes the if condition.
