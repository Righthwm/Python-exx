A dictionary in Python an unordered collection of data values. Similar to a dictionary in the real world with values (definitions) mapped to a specific key (words). Dictionary comprehension is one way to create a dictionary in Python. It creates a dictionary by merging two sets of data which are in the form of either lists or arrays.The data of one of the two lists/arrays will act as the keys of the dictionary while the data of the second list/array will act as the values. Each key acts as a unique identifier for each value, hence the size of both lists/arrays should be the same.
