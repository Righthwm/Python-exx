The main purpose of Python virtual environments is to create an isolated environment for Python projects. This means that each project can have its own dependencies, regardless of what dependencies every other project has. The great thing about this is that there are no limits to the number of environments you can have since theyâ€™re just directories containing a few scripts. The venv module provides support for creating virtual environments with their own site directories, optionally isolated from system site directories.
