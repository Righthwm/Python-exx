A Python program terminates as soon as it encounters an error. In Python, an error can be a syntax error or an exception. In syntax errors case, the parser repeats the offending line and displays a little ‘arrow’ pointing at the earliest point in the line where the error was detected. The error is caused by (or at least detected at) the token preceding the arrow. File name and line number are printed so you know where to look in case the input came from a script. Even if a statement or expression is syntactically correct, it may cause an error when an attempt is made to execute it. Errors detected during execution are called exceptions and are not unconditionally fatal. Most exceptions are not handled by programs, however, and result in error messages.
